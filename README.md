# tata-sky-remote
tata sky remote using arduino with GUI in python

Decoding IR hex code using Arduino IR library with help of IRrecvDumpV2.ino
then writing code with help of IRsendRawDemo.ino as it was not standard remote like Sony,NEC etc.

Then transmitting that values through IR transmitter.
To make better GUI I used tkinter module of python.
